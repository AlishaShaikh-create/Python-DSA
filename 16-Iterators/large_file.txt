A poem is a form of literary art using rhythmic, aesthetic language—such as rhyme, metaphor, and meter—to evoke emotions or ideas beyond literal meaning. Ranging from structured forms like sonnets and haikus to free verse, poems utilize techniques like alliteration and imagery to create musical or artistic effects. 
Whispers of Time
The clock ticks on with quiet might,
Chasing away the fading light.
Minutes turn to hours unseen,
Painting the world in shades of green.
A silent, steady, forward flow,
Watching the seasons come and go
